IgemRNA
---------
*IgemRNA* is transcriptome analysis `MATLAB <https://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html?s_tid=hp_products_matlab>`_ software with a graphical user interface (GUI) designed   for the analysis of transcriptome data directly or the analysis of context-specific models generated from the provided model reconstruction, transciptome and optional medium     composition data files. *IgemRNA* facilitates some of the `Cobra Toolbox 3.0 <https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox/>`_ constraint-based modelling functionalities for          context-specific model generation and performing optimisation methods like `FBA <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/latest/modules/analysis/FBA/index.html>`_ 
or `FVA <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/modules/analysis/FVA/index.html>`_ on them.
Furthermore, *IgemRNA* can be used to validate transcriptomics data taking into account the interconnectivity 
of biochemical networks, steady state assumptions and Gene-Protein-Reaction (GPR) relationship. The result context-specific models can then be further analysed and compared to other phenotypes. The main advantage of *IgemRNA* software is that no previos programming skills are required due to the integrated user-friendly GUI which allows to select data files and data processing options in the *IgemRNA* form (see fig. 1).

Folder structure description
**********
The *IgemRNA* tool initially consists of 2 root folders (`Data <https://github.com/BigDataInSilicoBiologyGroup/IgemRNA/tree/main/Data>`_, `Scripts <https://github.com/BigDataInSilicoBiologyGroup/IgemRNA/tree/main/Scripts>`_), additional result folders are created when specific analysis tasks have been performed (*Results non-optimization, Results post-optimization*)   
and an `IgemRNA.m <https://github.com/BigDataInSilicoBiologyGroup/IgemRNA/blob/main/IgemRNA.m>`_ file which calls the user graphical interface form. 
*Data* folder stores all input data files used for this tutorial and *Scripts* folder consists of all the script files that are being executed by the *IgemRNA* software according user-selected options in the *IgemRNA* form as well as the test cases provided in this demonstration.
The *Results non-optimization* (results of direct transcriptome analysis) and *Results post-optimization* (results of context-specific model analysis) are folders where all the result files are saved. 


Running IgemRNA software
**********
In order to run *IgemRNA* the user must first have the `MATLAB <https://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html?s_tid=hp_products_matlab>`_ environment installed and started as well as have the `IgemRNA <https://github.com/BigDataInSilicoBiologyGroup/IgemRNA>`_ software downloaded and the files extracted. Then the user can navigate to the root folder of *IgemRNA* in *MATLAB* where the `IgemRNA.m <https://github.com/BigDataInSilicoBiologyGroup/IgemRNA/blob/main/IgemRNA.m>`_ file is located and run it. 


Input data files
**********
To access all options in the *IgemRNA* form, the user must supply input data files. This can be done by pressing the *Open* button in the corresponding file upload row and selecting the files via *File Explorer*. **Transcriptomics data file** (see fig. 2B) is required to run *non-optimization tasks* but an additional **model reconstruction file** is required to access the *post-optimization tasks*. **Medium composition data file** (see fig. 2A) is optional, the selection of this data file does not extend the form, but specifies the provided exchange reaction constraints (upper and lower bounds) in the model for *post-optimization tasks* analysis.

Transcriptomics data and medium composition data can be provided in *.xls* or *.xlsx* formats, where columns are named respectively (see fig. 2) and sheet names correspond to dataset and phenotype names (*dataSetName_phenotypeName*). The model reconstruction file can be provided in *.xls*, *.xml* or other formats supported by *Cobra Toolbox 3.0.* **In case the transcriptomics data consists of multiple datasets, the genes listed in each dataset must be in the same order!**

Non-optimization tasks 
**********

Non-optimization tasks include several transcriptomics data analysis tasks: 

* filter highly and lowly expressed genes, 
* filter lowly expressed genes, 
* filter up/down regulated genes between different phenotypes or data sets. 

The results of each task are stored in a different folder within the *Results non-optimization* folder: *Gene expression level comparison*, *Highly-lowly expressed genes*, *Lowly expressed genes* (see fig. 3).

**********
1. Filter highly and lowly expressed genes
**********
Non-optimization task *Filter highly and lowly expressed genes* generates result *Excel* files for each provided transcriptomics dataset. File names are assigned based on the provided dataset and phenotype names (from transcriptomics data), the applied thresholding approach (*GT1, LT1, LT2*, more on thresholding: `ThresholdingGeneMappingOptions.docx <https://github.com/BigDataInSilicoBiologyGroup/IgemRNA/blob/main/Supplementary%20Materials%202/ThresholdingGeneMappingOptions.docx>`_) and provided global thresholds values (see fig. 4). Each result *Excel* file contains one sheet with the list of genes provided by transcriptomics data and 4 columns: *GeneId*, *Data* (expression value), *ExpressionLevel* and *ThApplied*. The *ExpressionLevel* column contains the expression levels determined based on the selected thresholding approach, provided global and for thresholding approaches *LT1* and *LT2* calculated local thresholds. Column *ThApplied* displays whether a local or a global threshold for a specific gene was applied (see fig. 5).

**********
2. Filter lowly expressed genes 
**********
Non-optimization task *Filter lowly expressed genes* generates separate *Excel* result files for each dataset provided in transcriptomics data file. These result files contain filtered gene lists including genes with expression value below the given threshold value/s based on the selected thresholding approach. File names include dataset and phenotype names (from transcriptomics data file), the applied thresholding approach (*GT1, LT1, LT2*, more on thresholding: `ThresholdingGeneMappingOptions.docx <https://github.com/BigDataInSilicoBiologyGroup/IgemRNA/blob/main/Supplementary%20Materials%202/ThresholdingGeneMappingOptions.docx>`_) and provided global threshold value/s (see fig. 6). Each result file consists of 4 columns *GeneId*, *Data* (expression value), *ExpressionLevel* (in this case, only *Low*) and *ThApplied* to show whether a global or a local threshold was applied for a specific gene. Only those genes with expression values below the given threshold (depending on which thresholding approach is applied) are listed in the result files (see fig. 7).

Post-optimization tasks
**********
Context-specific models generated by *IgemRNA* post-optimization tasks as well as the results of the analysis performed on these models are saved in the *Results post-optimization* folder (see fig. 10). The results of post-optimization tasks are saved in folders with corresponding names: *Flux-shifts*, *Non-flux reactions* and *Rate limiting reactions*.

   :width: 400

**fig. 10** - *Post-optimization results* folder

There are two ways to generate models used in this tutorial:

**1. Using GUI** - upload transciptomics data file, model reconstrucion file and optionally a medium composition file, select a thresholding approach, input threshold value/s, select gene mapping approach and constraining options, choose one or more *post-optimization tasks* options and press *OK*.

**2. Run test case file** from the *Scripts* folder of *IgemRNA* tool: `TestCase_createContextSpecificModel.m <https://github.com/BigDataInSilicoBiologyGroup/IgemRNA/blob/main/Scripts/TestCase_generateContextSpecificModels.m>`_
 
  Since model generation and optimisation takes some time, especially for multiple transcriptomics datasets, context-specific model files used for this demonstration have  already been provided in the `Results post-optimization/Context-specific models <https://github.com/BigDataInSilicoBiologyGroup/IgemRNA/tree/main/Results%20post-optimization/Context-specific%20models>`_ folder.
  
**********
1. Filter non-flux reactions 
**********
Post-optimization task *Filter non-flux reactions* performs an analysis on created context-specific models of the same phenotype, the name of the phenotype is included in the result file name (see fig. 11). Each result *Excel* file contains a list of reactions that carry no flux in the result context-specific model (lower and upper bound equals 0). An additional sheet for all the common non-flux reactions of the same phenotype is also provided in the sheet *Common_(phenotypeName)* (see fig. 12).
